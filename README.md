#   Arduino Water Level Timer Tracker

The purpose of this project was to create a device that can track liquid level, status, and presence in a cup. With the data collected by the various measurements, the device would then calculate the time taken to drink a full cup of liquid (eg. water, soda, or beer). Using an Arduino microcontroller and other various electronic components, the device would measure the presence of liquid in a cup and determine if a user is drinking from the cup and time how long it may take them to drink all the liquid from the cup.

* The project aimed to create a device using an Arduino microcontroller that could track liquid level, status, and presence in a cup to calculate the time taken to drink a full cup of liquid. 
* The device utilized a self-made capacitance sensor, an RGB LED to indicate the different states of the cup, and a timer to track the duration of drinking. A screen was added to display the time taken to drink, and a calibration mode and countdown button were included for better accuracy and game experience. 
* The project provided the opportunity to learn about electrical engineering, including designing a sensor with limited resources, using an OLED screen, and understanding raw data from voltage readings.
